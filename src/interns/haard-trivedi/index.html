            <p>Hello there (General Kenobi, sorry had to say it) - Welcome to my page!</p>
            <p>I am currently a 4th year student at the University
                of Ottawa working towards my undergraduate for Bachelor's
                of Applied Sciences in Software
                Engineering with 20 months of experience under my belt. I consider myself fluent in 4 languages -
                English, French, Gujarati and
                Hindi.</p>
            <p>
                My journey to being a software engineer began in grade 10. I took my first course in Computer Studies
                during which we were taught Visual Basic (Yes, I was surprised too). I have always been a problem solver
                and liked working my way through any challenges presented to me using logic and a step-by-step process.
                I knew ever since that first lecture that I wanted to go on and become a software engineer.
            </p>
            <p>I personally love working on backend engineering as I found it challenging while being subtle. I am
                interested in
                working within the AI/ML Cloud Engineering and Cybersecurity
                fields. However, I enjoy learning new technologies to enhance my knowledge.
            </p>
            <p>In my spare time, I am a vivid reader, sports enthusiast and a geek of a multitude of TV shows.
                Among my favourite books are the Harry Potter, LOTR and Percy Jackson series. I cheer for the
                Toronto Maple Leafs & Raptors year in, year out and love cricket as well (Mumbai Indians/Team
                India). Also, if there's a sitcom that's created a lot of buzz, I've probably watched it - HIMYM
                and Brooklyn 99 are my top 2 (please don't ask me to pick 1).
            </p>
            <p>
                I am very interested in Lob as a company and am looking forward to hearing back from your end quickly.
